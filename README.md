Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, and they wanted me to design a system for their driving school that would provide learning modules, online tests, and the ability to purchase packages for driving lessons online. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I analyzed the user interface needs well, particularly because I also took a UI design course this term.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the functional requirements. I feel like I did not get a good enough grasp on what a functional requirement truly entails. I would do more research into the functional requirements other similar systems have and then look over what I designed for my system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I constantly looked over the DriverPass interview transcript and implemented as many of Liam's wishes as I could into the design. It is important to consider users' needs when designing because, in the end, they will be the ones that interact with it the most, especially an administrator - probably even more than the developers of the system. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by prioritizing user requests and industry best practices. In the future, I would host more interviews rather than just the one that a transcript was provided from. I think having interviews and meetings with clients throughout the entire process is necessary to get a system that everyone is happy with.
